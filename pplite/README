This package is a wrapper for the PPLite library
(https://github.com/ezaffanella/PPLite)

Requirements:
- APRON
- ITV
- PPLite library version 0.12 (to be installed from sources)
- Flint, MPFR, GMP
- for apron_pplite_test: NewPolka APRON module

If HAS_PPLITE is defined in ../Makefile.config, then the main APRON Makefile
will automatically build and install this module.

What is provided:
- a manager to access the polyhedra domains provided by PPLite, including:
    Poly: standard (C or NNC) convex polyhedra domain
    F_Poly: Poly domain enhanced with Cartesian factoring
    U_Poly: Poly domain optimized for unconstrained dimensions
    UF_Poly: Poly domain combining F_Poly and U_Poly
    P_Set: powerset of convex polyhedra
    FP_Set: powerset of convex polyhedra with Cartesian factoring
- C++ exceptions are mapped back to APRON exceptions
- flag_exact and flag_best are correcty sets
- all the widenings are available through the algorithm parameter
- some functions not availble in PPLite are emulated
- a unit testing program ap_pplite_test for regression testing;
  it works by comparing the result of PPLite and NewPolka
  on random polyhedra

Limitations:
- all domains are experimental but tested
- partial support for PPLite's powerset of polyhedra (use of functions
  that are not in Apron's generic interface require explicit casts)
- some functions are not implemented: fprintfdiff, (de)serialize_raw

How to install:
- setup in ../Makefile.config (PPLITE_PREFIX, FLINT_PREFIX)
- compile and optionally install APRON with NewPolka
- make         => C library
- make ml      => OCaml library
- make java    => Java library
- make install => install C and (if compiled) OCaml and Java libraries
